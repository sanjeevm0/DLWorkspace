This video introduces DL Workspace, an 
open source toolkit for turn-key AI Cluster setup and operation. 

DL Workspace provides out-of-box support for 
multiple Deep Learning toolkits, and big data analytical kits.
It is used daily by Microsoft employees, and 
allows AI scientists to run both interactive 
and batch jobs on cluster.

The rest of the video explains the process 
to launch an interactive TensorFlow job. 

First, log in via your favorite provider through open id. 

Once logged in, click “Submit New Job”

Select a job template, and make optional adjustment. 

Click the “Submit” button to schedule the job for execution. 

Click “View and Manage Jobs”, and select proper job ID 
to monitor the jobs you have just executed. 

You may need to wait a few seconds to a few minutes for 
the job container to be scheduled, downloaded, and launched. 

Wait for “Mapped Endpoints” to appear. 

Copy the security token for the Jupyter notebook, 
and then click the Mapped Endpoint to access the job container. 

Paste the security token, and click “Log In”. 

You now have access to a fully functional TensorFlow container. 
If requested, GPU resources will be 
available and attached to the container. To access
TensorFlow tutorial, click the link “notebooks”.

Choose one of the “TensorFlow” tutorials. 

You are now in a Jupyter notebook, with both TensorFlow 
software and GPU hardware pre-setup. 

You can write your own program, execute the code, 
and interactively explore the inner working of DNN models. 

DL Workspace provides turn-key setup for AI clusters, 
allows AI scientists to jump directly to work, and 
facilitates collaboration and sharing.
