This video introduces DL Workspace, an 
open source toolkit for turn-key AI Cluster setup and operation. 

DL Workspace provides out-of-box support for 
multiple Deep Learning toolkits, and big data analytical kits.
It is used daily by Microsoft employees, and 
allows AI scientists to run both interactive 
and batch jobs on cluster.

The rest of the video explains the process to 
install DL Workspace on Azure.


You need a development machine running Ubuntu OS. 
You may then either install docker, and build DL 
workspace dev docker; or run installation scripts 
that will install docker, python and Azure CLI on your machine.  

Prepare the configuration file. You need the name of the 
cluster, # of infrastructure and worker node, deployed 
azure location, and type of VM size. 

Depending on your Open ID provider, configure the Open 
ID endpoint, and put the information into the configuration file. 

Log in to your azure account via az login. Then run the 
following scripts in sequence to create Azure VM, generate 
configuration file for the Azure Cluster, and deploy 
kubernete cluster & DL Workspace runtime. 

After the scripts run through, please wait a few minutes 
for the container to start. You should have a fully function 
cluster.
