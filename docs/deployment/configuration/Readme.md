# Configure DL workspace cluster

This document describes the procedure to write a configuration file for your DL workspace cluster. 

Please copy the configuration template at /src/ClusterBootstrap/config.yaml.template to /src/ClusterBootstrap/config.yaml. Then, please edit the config.yaml file and provide the following information:

1. {{cluster_name}}: replace it with the your DL workspace cluster name, e.g., ccs1

2. {{etcd_node_num}}: replace it with the number of Etcd servers. For a production cluster, this should be at least 3 for reliability. It is OK to use 1 for a test cluster. Please note that if you select to use N etcd servers, you should setup exactly that number of etcd server during deployment. 

3. {{apiserver_password,apiserver_username,apiserver_group}}: replace it with a password, a username and the group of API server. If you use "helloworld,adam,apig", then the API server can be administered through username adam, and password helloworld. Please do **__not__** put space in the string, as the space will be taken as part of the username/password.  

DL workspace will also support an additional optional configuration file for clusters that provides detailed customization. 

A template can be found at /src/ClusterBootstrap/cluster.yaml.template. If used, please copy the template to cluster.yaml. The cluster.yaml can contain cluster specific configuration, e.g., script to deal with multiple network interface, Mac address, IP mapping, etc..

Both configuration files will be merged inside DLWorkspace for operation.
