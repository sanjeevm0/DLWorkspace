# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for ACS Deployment. 

Please refer to [this](../knownissues/Readme.md) for more general deployment issues. 

## After setup, I cannot visit the deployed DL Workspace portal. 

* Please wait a few minutes after the deployment script runs through to allow the portal container to be pulled and scheduled for execution. 

## I can't execute Spark job on Azure. 

The current default deployment procedure on Azure doesn't deploy HDFS/Spark. So Spark job execution is not available. 

## For 'az login', when I type in the device code, the web page prompt me again for the code. 

It seems that sometime the browser (Edge, Chrome) cache another identity not intended to be used with az login. To get around, please start the browser in (in-private) or (incognito) mode, you may then enter the proper device code. 

## The deployment script returns with error 

    ```
    Deployment failed. {
    "error": {
        "code": "BadRequest",
        "message": "The credentials in ServicePrincipalProfile were invalid...
    ```

    It seems that ACS creation fails from time to time. Please try to rerun the script. If things repeat, please consider to use [Azure Cluster](../Azure/Readme.md) deployment first till we investigate and fix the issue. 

## I have launched a job (e.g., TensorFlow-iPython-GPU). However, I am unable to access the endpoint with error 

    ```This site canâ€™t be reached
    k8s-agent-d544f279-0.northcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com refused to connect.
    ```

    Please check the docker image of the job you are running. Sometime, the iPython (or SSH server) hasn't been properly started, which caused the endpoint to be not accessible.  

## I notice that my azure command is failing. 

Azure CLI may time out after inactivity. You may need to re-login via 'az login'.
